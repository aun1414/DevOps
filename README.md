Linux Commands
If you’re a computer science major, you are definitely familiar with what Linux is and how it works. We’ve all worked with basic commands like cd, touch, mkdir but we often tend to overlook some of the complex but useful commands. In this article, we’ll explore some of these commands and make you a Linux pro!

less
The less command accesses file one page at a time and displays it. This is useful when the text files are too large to display at once and this consequently results in faster reload speeds.

uname
Uname is short for UNIX name. This command is used to check system information of the computer you’re on. It can check details such as OS Details, OS Architecture, Linux Kernel Version and Kernel Release.

tar
The tar command which is short for “tape archive” is used to save a number of files into an archive file. These files can later be extracted in the archive file.

sort
The sort command does exactly what its name suggests. It sorts the contents of a text file, line by line. It can sort alphabetically, reverse order, number, month etc.

ps
Ps is short for process status and is used to check information related to the processes running on the system. It lists down the current running processes on the system and their process IDs

chmod
Chmod command is used to manage permissions on files or directories. It can manage read and write permissions individually.

whatis
The whatis command is used to get a single page manual description as in Linux, each page has a description.

wget
Wget is a network file downloader. Its main purpose is to make file downloads easy. It comes with features such as downloading large files or mirror complete web/ftp sites

traceroute
A feature for networks! It prints the route of the packet that it takes to reach the host destination. This command is mostly used when you want to know about all the hops that a packet takes.

diff
Diff command is used to find differences between a file and does it line by line. It can also compare the the contents of directories.


Github commands

Git branch
This command is for managing branches. It lets you create different development environments within a single repository.

Git checkout
Git checkout is used to easily move between various branches in the repository. When used with basic Git commands, it can become a powerful tool to work on a specific line of development.

Git status
It shows the state of the working directory and the staged snapshot. If you run this command with git add and commit

Git revert
It undoes a committed stage. If there’s an error in the branch, you can safely roll back and undo all the changes

git reset
It reverts changes in the files in the working directory. It lets you cleanup or totally remove the changes that have not yet been pushed to the repository

git reflog
It keeps track of updates made on the branches using a mechanism called reflog. This allows us to go back to the changes even if they are not referenced by any branch.

git push
It allows you to push a local branch to another repository which is how you publish contributions

Git rebase
It helps to move branches around, which helps you avoid unnecessary merge commits.
